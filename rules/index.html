     <p>
    Sitespeed uses rules to decide if a page is optimized for performance. The rules are based on perfromance best practices, check out the exact rules used
    <a href="https://github.com/soulgalore/yslow/blob/master/src/common/rulesets/ruleset_sitespeed.js" target="_blank">here</a>.
 
  </p>
      <h2>Modified Yslow rules</h2>
      <p>
        Sitespeed uses many rules from Yslow (read about them
        <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
        The only yslow rule that isn't used by sitespeed, is the CDN rule. Also the tolerance for number of request is less with sitespeed (max 2 js, 2 css and 3 css images).

  <div class="span12">
    <h3 id="cssprint">Do not load specific css for print</h3>
    <p>
      Loading a specific stylesheet for print, can block rendering in your browser (depending on version) and will for almost all browsers, block the onload event to fire (even though the print stylesheet isn't even used). You can read more about it
      <a href="http://www.phpied.com/5-years-later-print-css-still-sucks/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cssinheaddomain">Load CSS in head from document domain</h3>
    <p>
      CSS files in head, should be loaded from the same domain as the main document, in order to avoid DNS lookups. This is extra important for mobile.
    </p>

    <h3 id="syncjsinhead">Never load JS synchronously in head</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript files should never be loaded synchronously in head, because it will block the rendering of the page. Alternative version to yjsbottom rule, that don't seems to work with phantomjs.
    </p>

    <h3 id="avoidfonts">Avoid use of web fonts</h3>
    <p>
      Avoid use of webfonts because they will decrease the performance of the page. Read <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/10/13/font-face-and-performance/">more</a>.
    </p>


    <p>There are also two rules borrowed from Stoyan Stefanov.</p>
    
    <h3>Load third party JS asynchronously</h3>
    Always load third party javascript asynchronously. Third parties that will be checked are twitter, facebook, google (api, analythics, ajax), linkedin, disqus, pinterest & jquery. Read more about asynchronously third party scripts 
    <a href="http://www.phpied.com/3PO#async" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h3>Load the third party JS only once</h3>
    Make sure the third party javascripts are loaded only once. More info
